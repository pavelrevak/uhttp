HTTP to HTTPS redirect server example

This example shows how to run two servers:
- HTTP server on port 80/8080 that redirects all requests to HTTPS
- HTTPS server on port 443/8443 that serves actual content

Requirements:
1. Generate SSL certificate and key:
   openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes

2. Run the servers:
   python examples/http_to_https_redirect.py

3. Test with:
   curl -L http://localhost:8080/test
   curl -k https://localhost:8443/test
